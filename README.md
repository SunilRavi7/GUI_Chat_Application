# GUI_Chat_Application
GUI Chat Application using Python, and Socket IO development of a GUI-based chat application using Python, leveraging the Tkinter library for the user interface and Socket programming for the client-server communication.  The application is built on a client-server architecture.
The process of conversing, engaging, and/or exchanging messages through the Internet is referred to as chatting. It involves two or more people communicating via a chat-enabled service or program.
Chat can be given via the Internet using text, voice, or video communication. A chat program is made up of two fundamental components: a server and a client.
A Server is a computer program or hardware device that offers functionality to other programs or hardware. 
 A Client or clients are simply persons who wish to communicate with one another. Also, clients first need to connect to the server and then the server will work as a medium between clients.
The chat program we’ll create will be more like a chat room than a peer-to-peer chat. As a result, numerous users can connect to the chat server and submit messages. Any message is sent to every chat user that is connected.
